# A MacOS keymap based on the Default Planck Layout

### All modifiers used assume you are on MacOS. If you want to use this in Linux or windows, be sure to replace all instances of ```KC_LGUI``` by the appropriate modifier (most probably ```KC_LCTL```) and also replace ```KC__VOLDOWN``` with ```KC_VOLD``` and ```KC__VOLUP``` with ```KC_VOLU``` 

``` ` ``` and ```Ëœ``` have been moved to ```raise esc``` and ```lower esc``` respectively, so as to not depend on pressing the rotary encoder.

```tab``` is mapped to both ```lower space``` and ```raise space``` for the same reason as above.

The rotary encoder has the following mapping:

- normal: scroll up and down
- lower: undo and redo
- raise: find next and find previous. The click action will copy the selected text and find it
- lower+raise: volume up and down, with mute/unmute on click
